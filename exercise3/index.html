        <p>Hi there, I am Jaka, a geographer and an ICT student. I hold a Master's degree in spatial planning and regional development.<br> 
            However, I am always looking for ways improve my skills and since I was always interested in IT, I decided to apply to the ICT programme at 
            <a href="https://www.jamk.fi/fi/Etusivu/" target="_blank">JAMK</a> and make a career change.</p>
            
            <p>I am originally from Croatia, but now I am based in Jyväskylä, Finland.
            In 2020, I have decided to <em>permanently</em> move to Finland together with my Finnish fiancé.</p>
            
            <p>Having worked in GIS industry and management consulting, I developed an passion for data analysis and GIS technologies and its application to promote sustainable development.
                My goal is to develop skills in software engineering, but also analytics. My hope is to use these skills to work on sustainability projects.</p>
            <p>This place was made to share my professional development, work experiences and projects with potential employers, co-workers or partners.<br>
            Feel free to explore and connect with me via LinkedIn.
