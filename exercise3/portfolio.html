            <p><b>#30DayMapChallenge2020</b><br><i>November 2020</i></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I jumped into the challenge mid-November and used it to get back into making maps for fun.</li>
                    <li>Although I didn't make many, I learned a lot about data availability in Finland by exploring various data sources and databases. 
                        I also learned a lot about Finland's geography, it's people, where they live and how they use their land.</li>
                    <li>I tried to use maps to highlight important issue of family violence, especially in Covid-19 situations.</li>
                    <li>Most of all, I wanted to challenge myself to make interesting and fun maps, use new tools or design and simply enjoy the map making process.</li>

            <p><b>Modelling urban charging network for electric vehicles</b><br><i>Spring 2020</i></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>As part of my work in consulting, I was assigned to a project to model a charging network in an urban area. Our task was to answer where in a given 
                        urban area can a charger be and what kind of charger would that be.
                        I worked with in a team with three other colleagues. However, my main task was to use QGIS to analyse and model the data.</li>
                    <li>Together we produced a map which shows all the possible locations for an electric vehicle charger. These locations are located in more or less 
                        favourable area for installing charging infrastructure which further informs the client whether it is worth building at a certain location.</li>

            <p><b>IFHP summer school - "Vaasanpuisto - embracing the water"</b><br><i>August 2019 in Turku, Finland</i></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The school's aim is to provide hands-on experience in planning and design of a real world space. I worked in a team with four 
                        talented people with different backgrounds, nationalities and professions. Four teams on total were tasked to create unique project proposals 
                        for the development of Vaasanpuisto in Turku, Finland.</li>
                    <li>Ours was called "Vaasanpuisto - embracing the water" and it focused on the analysis of urban systems which directly contribute to the site 
                        and promoted an organic transformation of the area over time in four phases.</li>

            <p><b>The Compass Project - “Design, art and craft in Ilica street: The urban laboratory”</b><br><i>Oct 2016 - May 2017, Croatia</i></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The proposal was called “Design, art and craft in Ilica street: The urban laboratory”. The area in question was traditionally occupied by 
                        creative industries, artists and craftsmen, but due to political changes in the 90s, land value and land use change these activities were becoming 
                        difficult to maintain. This resulted in many abandoned locations, low social and economic energy and lack of services for local inhabitants.</li>
                    <li>Our team proposed to revitalize the street by returning to traditional activities and by introducing elements of green infrastructure. This would 
                        keep the sense of place while also introducing new social and economic energy to the area.</li>
