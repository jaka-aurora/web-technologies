                <section class="left"><span><i class="fas fa-user-astronaut fa-2x"></i> About me</span> Hi there, I am Jaka, a geographer and an ICT student. I hold a Master's degree in spatial planning and regional development.<br>
                    I am always looking for ways improve my skills and since I was always interested in IT, I decided to apply to the ICT programme at JAMK and make a career change.<br>
                    I am originally from Croatia, but now I am based in Jyväskylä, Finland. In 2020, I have decided to <em>permanently</em> move to Finland together with my Finnish fiancé.

                <section class="right"><span><i class="fas fa-map-signs fa-2x"></i> Goals </span> Having worked in GIS industry and management consulting, I developed an passion for data analysis and GIS technologies and its application to promote sustainable development.<br>
                My goal is to develop skills in software engineering, but also analytics and I hope to use these skills to work on sustainability projects.
                This place was made to share my professional development, work experiences and projects with potential employers, co-workers or partners.<br>
                Feel free to explore and connect with me via LinkedIn.
